# LetsParkServer

This repo contains a REST API developed during my time working with Dr. Mehdi Kargar as part of the University of Windsor’s Outstanding Scholars program.

The web service was developed using Node.js, and it serves as the middleware for the LetsPark mobile application (whose source code can be found in my “LetsPark” repository). It connects with a MySQL database instance (also designed by me) and features password encryption.
